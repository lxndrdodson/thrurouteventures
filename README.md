While I was in undergrad, I started a company called Boost Linguistics with a coworker. Our team built a nlp software that edits for emotion. The Boost Editor takes a written piece and acts as an emotional thesaurus, helping users to optimize social media posts and other written content for Joy, Fear, Anger, Sadness, and Disgust. My background is in sales, I collaborated closely with my development and project management teams to learn about the software we built and realized that coding and technology will only continue to grow exponentially. We will continue to enjoy and despair in this world alongside these computer languages. Having fought it for a long time, this opportunity came across as a display banner or an email somewhere and I learned about the Northwestern program. I'm from Chicago and recently moved back to the area, this year alone I started a job, left that job to do client work, and am now making a career change towards fintech because neither end of this industry are going anywhere and it will ultimately serve me to have these hard skills. These vectors are integral to being an entrepreneur in 2020.
